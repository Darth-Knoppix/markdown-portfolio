## Find me and my work

You can find me in various corners of the internet, if you'd like follow me here, there and everywhere. These are the platforms I hang out on the most and you can engage with my articles and myself.

I tweet about what I find  interesting in web and game development. You never know, you might find somethting new!

### [Delve into Seth's repos on GitHub](https://github.com/Darth-Knoppix)
I don't have any big open source projectes (unfortunately) but I do make the source code of projects for articles here. Feel free to follow along with my tutorials and investigate the code in all its glory. Sometimes you just need to see the code.

### [Learn and explore new web development trends on Benevolent Bytes Blog](https://blog.sethcorker.com)
I enjoy detailing my expereinces as a software engineer. I also explore frameworks and libraries in the React ecosystem which I don't always get to play with at my job. I try and highlight why you might want to consider a new JS library or walk you through how to use new libraries. You'll also find some articles related to becoming a better developer and my thoughts on the world of web development.

### [Join in the conversation on the DEV Community](https://dev.to/darthknoppix)
DEV is a great way to reach out and interact with like-minded developers just like yourself, I get involved in discussions and post tutorials from Benevolent Bytes there too.

### [Watch Seth's indie game development journey](https://game-blog.sethcorker.com/)
When I started programming, I did it because I wanted to make games. This blog detailed some of my explorations in to game dev. Although I never became a professional game developer, I still enjoy it as a hobby. You'll find some of my early attempts with UDK now Unreal Engine, Unity and now Godot.

### [Support Benevolent Bytes on Medium](https://medium.com/front-end-field-guide)
Benevolent Bytes, my blog about web development, started on Medium. It finally outgrew the platform and I moved it to a new home - self-hosted by me. That's not to say Medium is stale now, I still repost articles to Medium but it's not the primary source. If you enjoy Medium and want to see me there, you can. Highlight and comment away.

### [Find zen as a software engineer on benevolent(self)](https://benevolentbytes.substack.com/)
Benevolent(self) is a place to explore the things around the code. The soft skills that every developer should explore but few focus on. I wanted to create a new space to help developers become more in-tune with themselves and become better developers becuase of it.
