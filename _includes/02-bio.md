I'm a software engineer living and working in London with a lot of experience with React and JavaScript in general. I enjoy building interactive frontend experiences that delight people and are a joy to use. I love using new technologies and showcasing them on my blog is a fun way to learn new skills. 

You'll find tips, tricks and tutorials on my blog such as [animation with the new framer-motion React library](https://blog.sethcorker.com/framer-motion-2), a good introduction on the changes framer-motion have added since the first version. 

I also write about my experiences as a web developer and [how you can become a better developer too](https://blog.sethcorker.com/learning-when-the-tutorial-ends-why-building-something-is-a-great-way-to-learn).

I'm always ready to lend a helping hand! If you're a new developer or have been programming for a few years, I hope some of my articles give you some insight and help you improve your skills or expand your mind.
